# gChart

**gChart** is an experimental Go Package that allows you to generate html-based charts.

**gChart** uses [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference) 
in order to render several types of charts (for now only column, linear and area charts are 
supported).

## Examples and Usage

Go to [examples/line_chart.go](examples/line_chart.go) to see a simple example.

## Roadmap - Next features

- Add tests
- Add more examples
- Build a CLI app that uses gChart to produce PNG/PDF files
- Support more of Google Charts' features
